# AI-Powered-Narrative-Anomaly-Insights-for-Reporting
📖 README Structure for Workiva AI Demo Project
1. 🚀 Project Overview

Title: AI-Powered Narrative & Anomaly Insights for Reporting

Goal: Demonstrate how AI can streamline financial/ESG reporting by automatically generating executive-ready narratives and flagging anomalies from structured data.

Why Workiva: Aligns with Workiva’s mission of connected, compliant reporting by showing how LLMs + lightweight stats can save hours of analyst effort, reduce errors, and increase transparency.

2. 📈 Go-To-Market (GTM) Narrative

Target Users:

Compliance officers, financial controllers, ESG managers.

Value Prop:

Automate first-draft narratives and anomaly explanations.

Save 5–10 hours per filing cycle.

Reduce risk of oversight with structured anomaly flagging.

Differentiation:

Embedded directly in Workiva workflows (no copy-paste to/from external tools).

Built-in audit trail + governance controls (critical for enterprise).

Launch Motion:

Start with a “Smart Summary” beta in SEC reporting workflows.

Collect adoption metrics (time saved, % of reports using AI draft).

Expand to ESG, Risk, and Audit modules.

3. 📝 PRD Snapshot

Problem Statement: Analysts spend too much time drafting repetitive narratives and scanning for anomalies.

Proposed Solution: AI-generated summaries and anomaly callouts from connected data sources, with human review.

Success Metrics:

30% reduction in report prep time.

90% accuracy of metrics cited in AI output.

≥70% adoption in pilot teams.

4. 👩‍💻 User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

User Story 1:
As a compliance manager, I want AI-generated narrative summaries of quarterly metrics so I can focus on review instead of drafting.

✅ Upload/ingest data file.

✅ Receive draft narrative (3–5 sentences).

✅ Numbers must match source metrics.

User Story 2:
As a financial analyst, I want anomalies flagged and explained so I don’t miss critical risks.

✅ Outlier detection (z-score ≥2 or IQR bounds).

✅ LLM explains business context in <80 words.

✅ Each anomaly includes suggested follow-up.

User Story 3:
As an auditor, I want an audit trail of AI vs human edits so compliance is maintained.

✅ All AI outputs logged.

✅ Provenance shows source rows/columns.

6. 🛣️ Roadmap (Orchestration → Agentic AI)

Phase 1 (MVP / Today):

Upload → AI narrative + anomaly callouts → export.

Human review loop in Streamlit.

Phase 2 (Enterprise Orchestration):

Integrate with Snowflake/Sheets APIs.

n8n automations: nightly jobs → Slack notifications → auto-doc export.

API hooks for multi-team workflows.

Phase 3 (Agentic AI Workflows):

AI agent autonomously:

Monitors incoming data streams.

Detects anomalies.

Drafts narratives.

Routes draft via approval chain (Slack/Jira).

Submits final doc into Workiva filing pipeline.

Guardrails: human-in-the-loop approvals, full audit logs, provenance tags.

Phase 4 (Full Platform Integration):

Extend to ESG, Risk, Audit modules.

Multi-agent collaboration (e.g., “Narrative Agent” + “Risk Agent” + “Compliance Agent”).

MCP-enabled tool layer for secure, permissioned access to data + exports.

7. 📊 Metrics & Next Steps

Pilot KPIs: Time saved, adoption rate, accuracy of metrics.

Expansion KPIs: Filing error reduction, % anomalies explained, cross-module adoption.

Future Work:

MCP integration for secure tool access.

Local-model option (for data residency).

Continuous evaluation dashboard.

For the hiring team, it screams: “I can own AI product vision, delivery, and adoption at Workiva.”

Want me to go ahead and write the PRD section fully fleshed-out (with problem statement, goals, non-goals, assumptions, risks) so you can copy it directly into your README?

Got it 👍 — adding output evaluation criteria makes your README feel more “enterprise-ready” (governance, audit, QA). Here’s how you can slot it into the doc:

8. ✅ Output Evaluation Criteria

To ensure AI-generated narratives and anomaly explanations are reliable, outputs are evaluated against the following dimensions:

1. Accuracy

Numerical integrity: All numbers in the AI output must exactly match source data.

Consistency: No contradictory statements across different sections of the report.

2. Relevance

On-topic: Summaries must reference only provided metrics (no hallucinated KPIs).

Anomaly coverage: All flagged anomalies (z-score ≥2, IQR outliers) must be addressed in the narrative.

3. Clarity

Readability: Plain business English, ≤12th grade reading level.

Conciseness: Summaries ≤5 sentences, anomaly explanations ≤80 words.

Executive tone: Neutral, fact-based, avoids speculation unless marked as “possible causes.”

4. Auditability

Provenance: Each figure or anomaly explanation cites the exact source column/row.

Versioning: All AI outputs logged with timestamp + prompt + response.

Traceability: Audit trail shows human edits vs AI draft.

5. Robustness

Boundary handling: Borderline z-scores (2.0–2.2) labeled “borderline” rather than “critical.”

Missing data: Graceful degradation (skip or annotate missing values rather than invent).

Bias check: Ensure language is neutral (no loaded terms like “failure,” “catastrophic”).

6. Adoption Metrics

Human acceptance rate: % of AI sentences kept vs edited.

Analyst time saved: Minutes saved per filing cycle.

Coverage: % of filings/reports using AI draft.
